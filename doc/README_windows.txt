=====================

Intro
-----

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run credits-qt.exe.

Credits is the original Credits client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Credits transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
