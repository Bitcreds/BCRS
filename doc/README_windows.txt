Bitcreds 1.0.0.0
=====================

Intro
-----
Bitcreds uses peer-to-peer technology to operate securly with no central authority (decentralisation): managing transactions and issuing currency (BCRS) are carried out collectively by the Bitcreds network. Bitcreds is the name of open source software which enables the use of the currency BCRS.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run bitcreds-qt.exe.

Bitcreds is the original Bitcreds client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Bitcreds transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
